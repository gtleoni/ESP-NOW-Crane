# ESP-NOW-Crane

This is an plastic crane toy which was driven and powered from a wired controller. My daughter kept pulling the crane over, so I decided to swap it for a wireless controller. As I didn't want it dependant on a WiFi access point I opted to the use ESP-NOW features built into the ESP8266 (and ESP32).
